## Speculos builder

The Dockerfile `build.Dockerfile` builds a container with all required dependencies to build speculos:

```sh
docker build -f build.Dockerfile -t ledgerhq/speculos-builder .
```

The resulting container is pushed on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ledgerhq/speculos-builder) (by Ledger employees, obviously):

```sh
docker push ledgerhq/speculos-builder:latest
docker image tag ledgerhq/speculos-builder:latest ledgerhq/speculos-builder:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
docker push ledgerhq/speculos-builder:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
```

This container can eventually be used by the CI.

## Speculos

The Dockerfile `Dockerfile` builds a container with all required dependencies to run speculos from the command-line:

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile -t ledgerhq/speculos .
```

This should be done by the CI, which publish the resulting image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ledgerhq/speculos).
