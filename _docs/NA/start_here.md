#### Get in touch with the Ledger developer community

Join the [Ledger's Developer Slack](https://ledger-dev.slack.com) workspace to communicate with the developer community, and introduce yourself and your project through the dedicated channel, **\#introductions**.
Other useful channels are : **\#Support**, **\#Ledgerjs**, **\#Ledger-live**, **\#rust-sdk** and **\#speculos**.

#### Familiarize yourself with the BOLOS platform

BOLOS (Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System) is the operating system behind all Ledger personal security devices. It provides a lightweight, open-source framework for developers to build source code portable applications that run in a secure environment.

[Learn about the BOLOS platform](../b_overview)

#### Set up the BOLOS development environment
In order to build or compile BOLOS applications for Ledger devices, the appropriate environment must be set up. This environment consists in an SDK and two compilers.

[Follow our tutorial to set up the environment](../u_setup)

#### Write your application
We provide examples of good codebases which you can learn from, instructions on how to clone and make BOLOS applications, and how to manage the display.

[Find instructions here](../u_writing_apps)

#### If you want to submit changes to the documentation
Go to [this page](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/unos/tree/main/_docs) to make your submission


## Submit your app for the Ledger Live manager
Make sure that your app is ready before submitting it for review and that you have followed instructions from our documentation.

#### Design guidelines
The design of your device app will be added to our website to inform that your app is available. You must provide two icons that are compliant with the criteria established by our team.
See the [design guidelines here](http://localhost:4000/unos/docs/NA/a_publishing_an_app/#design-guidelines).

#### Internal process
When an app is submitted it will go through 3 main steps which are the functional review, the security review and the documentation review.

Click the links to see [security requirements](../a_security_guidelines), [documentation requirements](../a_documentation_requirements), and [functional requirements]().

#### Submission
Once your app is ready and you have made sure it follows our guidelines, you can submit it by completing a form. Make sure you thoroughly complete it as it will impact the speed of the release process.

Find the submission form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiNW1XvBP1FPZLn3OxsZKSOP9HAwlKvgKlz-DqLqMsv6_LXw/viewform).
