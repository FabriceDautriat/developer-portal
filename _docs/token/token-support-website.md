The list of supported assets on the [website](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets/) is managed through an internal Ledger process. For the moment itâ€™s difficult to guarantee the exact mapping between tokens available on Ledger Live and listed on the website. The true list of supported assets is visible [here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs/tree/master/packages/cryptoassets/data).  We will soon improve our process so that the [website](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets/) reflects exactly what is available on the Ledger Live software. In the meantime, the website list contains less tokens than the actual list.
